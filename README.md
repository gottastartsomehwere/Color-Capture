# Color-Capture
 Color Capture is a simple flask based app which can isolate a particular colour(selected by user) and process the output image where only that colour exists. 
 
 To Recreate the virtual environment required to run the app , users could use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the libraries required.
 
 This is a Test Project with a modest web design that looks to integrate python route handling and flask procedures with simple frontend.
